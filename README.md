# Simple_DNN
In this project I want to experiment with DNN, by noticing the how bad is the effect of introducing non-linearity in the layers
Project Idea: A dataset is made with random integers(2 series of random integers) and one series is the sum of these two columns(this will act as labels in my model.
              Now I will make a simple DNN with Keras(non-linearity will be introduced. And will check its performance on it.
               The objective is to see how much impact does non-linearity have in model learning.
